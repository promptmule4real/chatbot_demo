**Welcome to the Quick-Chat with Silicon Valley!**

Promptmule and Chainlit powered chat experience with Gilfoyle and Dinesh from "Silicon Valley." Engage in tech banter, seek coding tips, or spark a quirky debate, just like you're part of their startup world. Thanks to the guys at Chainlit for the example code (Dan C, et al)

**Quick Start:**
1. **Launch:** kickstart the chat. Your favorite characters from Silicon Valley await.
2. **Chat Away:** Shoot your questions or pick a tech topic. There's no script, so any chat direction is fair game.
3. **Keep Rolling:** No timeouts here. Chat until you've had your fill of their tech world insights (or sarcasm).
4. **Wrap It Up:** Done for the day? Just close the chat or say goodbye. Our AI characters know how to take a hint.
5. **Demo Promptmule:** check it out here: https://github.com/promptmule4real/promptmule_demo

**Pro Tips:**
- **Role-play for Fun:** Stay in character for the best banter. The AI is tuned to the show's vibe.
- **Mix Up Topics:** Tech, life, random thoughts â€” the broader your topics, the richer the chat.
- **Embrace Surprises:** Powered by advanced AI, expect witty, unexpected, or deep responses.
